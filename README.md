## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning (ML) study focused on classifying **Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)** using RNA-seq data. The project leverages **ensemble machine learning** with **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)** for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and tracks the **objective function (OF)** using a **custom scoring function (CSF)** for enhanced model interpretability. Key components include:

- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using edgeR for PDAC and asymptomatic control cases.
- **ML Pipeline**: Implementation of five ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting Machine) with TPE-based HPO.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combining two or three models, with a focus on the best-performing **SVM:RF:GBM ensemble** calibrated using Calibrated Logistic Regression (CLR).
- **Visualization**: 3D plots of HPO and OF tracking to provide insights into model optimization and performance.

The dataset is sourced from the **GSE183635** RNA-seq dataset available on the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183635), as published by S. In 't Veld et al., 2022 ([DOI: 10.1016/j.ccell.2022.08.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2022.08.006)).

## ðŸŽ¯ Aims of the Project
The objectives of this study are:
1. To optimize five ML algorithms (LR, SVM, RF, XGB, GBM) using TPE for hyperparameter tuning and evaluate their performance on PDAC classification.
2. To develop and evaluate ensemble models combining two or three algorithms, with a focus on the SVM:RF:GBM ensemble for superior predictive accuracy.
3. To enhance model interpretability using a custom scoring function (CSF) and 3D visualizations of HPO and OF tracking.
4. To provide a serialized, reproducible ensemble model (`Ensemble_SVM-RF-GBM_PMs_and_Probabilities.joblib`) for external validation and reuse.

## ðŸ”€ Workflow of the Project
![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kahkengwong/PDAC_paper/main/PDAC_Workflow.jpg)

- **Data Preprocessing**: Differential expression analysis using edgeR (`PDAC_DEGs_edgeR.r`) to identify DEGs from the RNA-seq expression matrix.
- **ML Model Optimization**: TPE-based HPO for five ML algorithms, followed by selection of the best gene combinations and hyperparameters.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combining models (e.g., SVM:RF:GBM) and calibrating the best ensemble using CLR.
- **Model Serialization**: Saving the final SVM:RF:GBM ensemble model with predicted probabilities and performance metrics in a Joblib file.
- **Visualization**: Generating 3D plots to visualize HPO and OF tracking for interpretability.

> **Note**: The workflow image (`PDAC_Workflow.jpg`) is a placeholder. Consider creating and uploading a workflow diagram to the repository for clarity.

## ðŸ“Š Project Key Findings
- The **SVM:RF:GBM ensemble** outperformed individual models, achieving high accuracy and robustness in PDAC classification.
- TPE-based HPO effectively identified optimal hyperparameters, improving model performance across all algorithms.
- The **custom scoring function (CSF)** enhanced interpretability by quantifying model performance and feature importance.
- 3D visualizations of HPO and OF tracking provided clear insights into the optimization process and model behavior.

> **Note**: Consider adding a figure summarizing key findings (e.g., `Project_Key_Findings.jpg`) to visually represent results, similar to the second repository.
